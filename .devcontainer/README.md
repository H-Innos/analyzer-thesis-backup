# Goblint devcontainer
This VS Code devcontainer provides a container-based development environment for Goblint.
For introduction and prerequisites, see <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers>.

There are two ways to activate the devcontainer:
1. Select "Reopen in Container" in the notification after opening VS Code.
2. Select "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container" from the command palette.

The devcontainer automatically sets up the environment for Goblint, including development tools and VS Code extensions.
